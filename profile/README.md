## 🎯 Vision

The Synergy Framework is creating the **technological and educational infrastructure** needed for genuine democratic participation. We're building platforms, tools, and resources that empower people to engage meaningfully in shaping their shared future—moving beyond traditional political limitations toward evidence-based, collaborative decision-making.

> **Our mission**: Create the complete toolkit for democratic transformation, including governance platforms, educational resources, and participatory tools that make real democracy accessible to everyone.

## 🚀 What We're Building

### 🏛️ **Agora Protocol** 
*Liquid Democracy Platform - POC Complete*

![Agora Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/POC-Complete-success?style=flat-square)
![Features](https://img.shields.io/badge/Features-Core%20Ready-blue?style=flat-square)

A liquid democracy platform that makes governance accessible and transparent:

⚡ **Proposal submission** and community refinement workflows  
⚡ **Issue-specific voting** and flexible delegation  
⚡ **Interactive delegation mapping** and visualization  
⚡ **Transparent decision tracking** and accountability  
🔄 **In Progress**: Reputation system development  
📌 **Planned**: Educational integration and civic learning tools  

### 🧠 **METIS** 
*Psychohistory-Inspired AI - Concept Phase*

![METIS Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Research%20Phase-yellow?style=flat-square)
![Inspiration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Inspired%20By-Foundation%20Series-purple?style=flat-square)

A psychohistory-inspired AI system for strategic democratic intelligence:

🟢 Model large-scale social and political dynamics using statistical patterns  
🟢 Identify critical pressure points where interventions can have maximum positive impact  
🟢 Provide educational insights about policy trade-offs and probable outcomes  
🟢 Support evidence-based governance while preserving human agency and democratic values  
🟢 Enable strategic navigation through complex decisions without deterministic prediction  

*Currently seeking: AI/ML contributors, complexity scientists, and Foundation series enthusiasts*

### ⚙️ **Technical Foundation** 
*Infrastructure Libraries - Active Development*
